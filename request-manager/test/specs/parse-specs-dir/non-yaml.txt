Specs dir parse function should ignore non-yaml files (based on the filename extension).

This is not a yaml file.

Thus, the parse function should not attempt to parse it.

If it does, it will error. Because this is not a yaml file.

And, presumably, the yaml unmarshal function will error when it tries to unmarshal a non-yaml file.
